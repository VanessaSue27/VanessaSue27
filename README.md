### Hola! 🙋‍♀️, I'm Vanessa 🎈
#### ❣ Panamanian/ Belgian, living in Sweden~
**Fullstack Developer in the works.** Took my first steps into Web Development with Frontend and quickly discovered my preference for programming and cracking problems. I like my code functional and structured and I see myself digging deeper into more coding tools so I can contribute both with Front and Backend knowledge.

- 🔨 I'm currently working on my **Web Development skills**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native and Java (for now~).
- 🌈👩‍💻 This Fall I've joined the **Technigo Coding bootcamp**: a remote Frontend bootcamp to learn how to build web projects and digital products with code.
- I got a Bachelor in **Marketing & Advertising with focus on Graphic Design**
- I'm a **career changer** 💪 After 11 years working as a **Chef and Kitchen Manager**, I'm looking to reconnect with my creative side.
- Find me on **IG <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vanevalentine/" target="_blank">@vanevalentine</a>** where I often post about my coding progress (...and lots of food! 🍽🥗)
- I like sharing my coding projects at: **<a href="https://vanessa-portfolio.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Portfolio - Vanessa Sue Smith</a>** 😎
