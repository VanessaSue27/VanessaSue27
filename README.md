### Hola! 🙋‍♀️, I'm Vanessa 🎈
#### ❣ Panamanian/ Belgian, living in Sweden~
I've always enjoyed creating things — I love colorful visuals and the process behind designing them.
I got a Bachelor in **Marketing & Graphic Design**, but then found my second passion in cooking when moving to Europe.
After 10 years of working at and managing kitchens, I'm now back chasing a career in design through Frontend Development.

- 🔨 I'm currently working on my **Frontend skills**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React (for now~).
- 🌈👩‍💻 This Fall I'm joining **Technigo's coding bootcamp**: a remote Frontend bootcamp to learn how to build web projects and digital products with code.
- Find me on **IG <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vanevalentine/" target="_blank">@vanevalentine</a>** where I often post about my coding progress (...and lots of food! 🍽🥗)
- I like sharing my practice coding projects at: **<a href="https://vanessasue27.github.io/" target="_blank">vanessasue27.github.io</a>** 😎
