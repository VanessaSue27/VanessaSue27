### Hola! 🙋‍♀️, I'm Vanessa 🎈

**Fullstack Web Developer.** Took my first steps into Web Development with Frontend and quickly discovered my preference for programming and cracking problems. I like my code functional and structured and I see myself digging deeper into more coding tools so I can contribute both with Front and Backend knowledge.

- 🌈👩‍💻 **Technigo Coding bootcamp** Fall 2020 Alumni: a Frontend bootcamp to learn how to build web projects and digital products with code.
