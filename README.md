### Hola! 🙋‍♀️, I'm Vanessa 🎈

**Full Stack Developer** - Took my first steps into Web Development with Frontend and quickly discovered my preference for logic and functionality implementation. A problem-solver at heart. I see myself digging deeper into more programming tools so I can contribute both with Front and Backend knowledge.

- **JavaScript developer 🤓 My favorite stack includes**: HTML, CSS, React, React Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
- 👩‍💻 Graduated the **Technigo Coding bootcamp** - Fall 2020 and I'm currently working as a Consultant at **Axakon** 🤸‍♀️
- I got a Bachelor in **Marketing & Advertising with a focus on Graphic Design**
- I'm a **career changer**: Worked for 11 years in the Restaurant industry before going into tech 👩‍🍳💪
